# Portfolio-2023
Updated Portfolio Site with a cleaner more modern UI and a better user experience.

## Purpose Of Site

This site was created as my landing page about who I am and what I do as a developer. It is my portfolio site where I showcase my existing projects and work. 
It's purpose is for potential clients and recruiters to review and see my projects and my personality. It's also an opportunity for me to experiment with unique
and cool ways of doing things, different from ways I'd solve problems for clients, it's a way for me to be unique and weird with my code and do whatever I wish to do
with it, whether its weird, or odd. The site is also meant as an example of my creative design choices and a showcase of how I write code in certain examples. I love
this site, and I think its a great representation of who I am in the tech world.

## Tech Used

This site was created using ReactJS, Material UI, NodeJS, ExpressJS and Socket.io!!!

## Todo List

The site is currently in development, it is a fork of my 2022 portfolio site, the header and footer stayed the same, but I revamped the about me sections,
and cleaned up a lot of the code and fixed a lot of UI and UX elements. Currently I am working on finishing the projects section, and making it look nice,
and I also need to revamp the Contact section to make it fit better with the theme of the site.
